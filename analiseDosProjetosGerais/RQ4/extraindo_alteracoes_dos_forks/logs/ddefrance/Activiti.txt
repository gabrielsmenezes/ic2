ddefrance/Activiti;02a4f88e8;Added a flag to indicate if the service step should add a sequence flow to the previous activity.  This is required for the complete form service task.

ddefrance/Activiti;9f4eff0e6;Merge pull request #1 from ddefrance/boundary-event
ddefrance/Activiti;f28444282;Reverting a change I made to the model to support lookups of the join gateway by the forkgateway.  Now we keep a map in the conversion object for this purpose and do not pollute the model with conversion necessities.

ddefrance/Activiti;25b83e88a;Fix for nested parallel gateways which were connecting join gateways in lane 1 to fork gateways in lane 2.

ddefrance/Activiti;d9383b191;Added a concept of an explicit end to a parallel instead of making the assumption that the last element in a list is the end of the parallel. This is because some elements may have conditional or boundary event flows which should not be sequenced to the join gateway.  If no explicit end is specified within the steps, then we will use the last element as always.

ddefrance/Activiti;ec75abed0;Added support for explicit exclusive gateways.  We could not use the choice step here because we did not want a corresponding fork gateway. Also added the ability to set Ids through the StepDefinitions.  If the id is null, one will be generated as always.  But setting a specific id allows us to build the sequence flows we want explicitly.
