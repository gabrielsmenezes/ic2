Tangoe/jhipster-registry;ee70059;Removed the "Remember Me" and the "Register User" and the "Forgot Password" link on the login page.  Removed the "Remember Me" because it is a security risk.  The password should be passed on each login.  Also removed the "Register user" and the "Forgot Password" because the registry only has one admin user and that password is set at deployment time.  Also, it did not work.
